"""Version stamp and deployment report.

This lives in a submodule rather than ``__init__.py`` on purpose. The QMT
sandbox loader never executes the root package -- it builds an empty module and
returns it, because the package's eager exports trip QMT's import allowlist:

    # QMT native allowlist rejects the root package eager exports.
    if name == "bigqmt_signal_trader":
        return module

So anything defined in ``__init__.py`` simply does not exist inside QMT. A
version stamp that is invisible in the one environment it exists to describe
would be worse than none at all.

Kept in step with pyproject.toml by tests/test_version_stamp.py. It sat at
0.2.0 for fifteen releases, which made it useless for its one job: telling a
deployed tree apart from the package it came from. Deploying into QMT is a file
copy, and QMT keeps modules in sys.modules across strategy re-runs, so "the
copy never happened" and "the copy landed but was not picked up" look identical
from the outside.
