"""An order id that is an int for MiniQMT and a string for the broker.

MiniQMT's ``order_stock`` returns an int: a positive 委托编号, or ``-1`` when the
submit failed. Big QMT has no such number -- ``get_trade_detail_data`` hands
back ``m_strOrderSysID``, the broker's 合同编号, which is a string. This bridge
was returning that string straight through (issue #113), so every caller
written against MiniQMT broke, and broke quietly:

    order_id = trader.order_stock(...)
    if order_id == -1:      # never true: "-1" != -1, so a rejected order
        ...                 # reads as success
    if order_id > 0:        # TypeError: '>' not supported between str and int

``OrderId`` is both. It *is* an int, so comparisons, ``isinstance`` and
arithmetic behave the way MiniQMT callers expect; and it carries the exact
broker string on ``.order_sys_id``, so a cancel sends back what QMT issued
rather than a number we invented -- including ids that are not numeric at all.

Where the 合同编号 is a plain positive integer (the usual case) the int value is
that same number and the two representations agree exactly. Where it is not,
the int is a stable surrogate derived from the string: still positive, so
``> 0`` keeps separating success from failure, while ``str()`` and the cancel
path use the real id.
