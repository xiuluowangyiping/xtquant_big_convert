"""Callback-fed order watch table (issue #164).

QMT PUSHES order facts at us: order_callback carries the remark, the contract
id (m_strOrderSysID) and the status. The settlement path was polling
get_trade_detail_data on the adjust thread to learn exactly these -- measured
135 query rounds in 3.6s for one cancel of a nonexistent order (#151), and
62/64 lookup rounds for one submit (#122).

Each order event teaches two directions:

  remark -> order_sys_id   submit settlement: "which id did the order get?"
  order_sys_id -> status   cancel settlement: "did it reach 54?"

Written from QMT's C++ callback thread, read from the adjust thread: a plain
dict under a lock, no new threads, bounded FIFO + TTL (same shape as
_order_identity_local in redis_rpc). Callbacks only fire in live run mode --
a miss must always mean "ask QMT", so the polling path stays as the fallback.
