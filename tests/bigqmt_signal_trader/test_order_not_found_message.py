"""The "order not found" message must name the cause it usually has (#122).

chinapsu's order came back SUBMITTED and then could not be found, 62 lookups
running. The cause was QMT's 模型交易 run mode: the 运行模式 column defaults to
模拟, and in that mode passorder matches internally and never reaches the
broker. The call succeeds, the id never arrives, positions and cash do not
move.

The message led with "check price range / permissions". adrian-liuc followed
that for two hours before finding the mode, then asked for the hint to be in
the text -- which is the whole point of a diagnostic that fires on a path the
caller cannot see.
