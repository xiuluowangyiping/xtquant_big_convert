"""Download jobs must not need a redis TRANSPORT, only a redis.

On a zmq deployment the async download API answered

    RuntimeError: download jobs require a Redis client

for submit_download_history_data, get_download_status and wait_download --
because handlers.download_job_redis_client was built only when the transport
was redis.

The worker on the other side of that None was running the whole time.
_pump_download_jobs runs on every adjust tick regardless of transport and gets
its client from _exec_event_redis, which exists precisely because "_rpc_service
has none, which is the zmq-transport case". So queued jobs would have been
processed; there was simply no way to queue one.

Both stores now take the same client, and _exec_event_redis is the one that
builds it -- not a second builder, because it caches. Its docstring records
why: a fresh client per call leaked a connection pool per event, and redis-py's
__del__ then raised an AttributeError that Python swallows as "Exception
ignored in", visible only in the QMT panel.
